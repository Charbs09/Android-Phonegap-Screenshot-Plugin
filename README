- What is this?
This is a plugin for Phonegap & Android that allows you to screenshot your app.

- Why do I need to use this?
Phonegap is written in HTML and JavaScript, which makes it difficult to implement some form of screen capture without
using an existing library. This plugin makes it really easy to add screen capture functionality to your app.

- What's included?
I've included everything you need to import this straight into Eclipse.
